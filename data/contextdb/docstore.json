Action Plan\r\nFS_BM Partners\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\nAlgebra 1 is a gateway to high school graduation and, therefore, economic mobility in America. Disproportionately, it has been a barrier for Black and Latinx students and students experiencing poverty. This pernicious inequity has persisted for generations. [1]  Many attempts to address it have been made, but weakly-class size reductions,  teacher training, tracking, de-tracking, federal and state grant programs. With Covid 19, the disparities have widened. There is a solution: high-dosage tutoring. X, and its predecessor Match Education, originated the idea in\r\n2004-embed one or two hours of tutoring within the regular school day. It was a bold idea public schools in America had done previously. And it worked at Match and under the leadership of its nonprofit spinoff, X Co. Six randomized controlled trials of X\u2019s core math intervention prove that when it is delivered correctly, following standards set by X Co. over the past 18 years, tutoring embedded in the regular school day can and will lead to the most significant gains in student achievement of any intervention ever rigorously studied in U.S. high schools, according to the University of Chicago. Well-trained and supported tutors, aligning their instruction to the student's classroom experience, will both remediate and accelerate student learning. At its highest fidelity, X's model closes up to two and a half years of the opportunity gap between students of color and white students; an average of 1-2 years is generally expected. With careful attention to the details, and to fidelity, building off its success directly partnering with districts, X Co.is expanding nationally with a model that equips districts themselves to implement high-dosage tutoring. With a world-class engineering team now an integral part of  X Co.can deliver software solutions as well as program design, training and monitoring services to scale its impact nationwide, and to ensure that tutoring is done right. If tutoring is done right, schools should, can, and will reimagine learning and will redesign to change their ways-to build the schedule, the budgets and the approach to human capital that will lift students and will break the generations of inequity in our public schools. That is the promise and vision of X\u2019s widespread impact Action Plan. The core of our plan will be our cohort model. We will generate market demand and then select, over three years, twenty U.S. public school districts to join us in designing their pathways to embed tutoring as a core element of their budgets, schedules and approach to human capital. These districts will represent the range of U.S. districts by size, but all will have a concentration of schools serving high percentages of students experiencing poverty. In these districts, we will co-design a program that will deliver the key elements of X\u2019s direct services model, run by the districts and focused on helping students clear the Algebra 1 bar that is a gateway to high school graduation. And once we demonstrate that any district can do this, we will open up the future of redesigning America's schools to work for kids.\r\n \r\n\r\nPROBLEM AND TARGET POPULATION\r\n\"It is doubtful that any child may reasonably be expected to succeed in life\r\nif he is denied the opportunity of an education. Such an opportunity, where the state has undertaken to provide it, is a right which must be made available to all on equal terms.\"\r\n-U.S. Supreme Court, Brown v. Board of Education, 1954\r\nIn America, fair and equal access to education is considered a fundamental right. The reality, however, is that the American public education system persistently and systemically underserves students of color and students from lower income communities. More than half a century after Brown v. Board of Education, our schools continue to be resourced unequally along racial lines. While most white students will attend a high school that offers calculus,\r\ntwo-thirds of Blacks will not. Majority-white schools receive, on average, $2,000 more in funding per pupil than do majority-Black schools. [2]\r\nWith each year of schooling, the effects of these racial inequities are compounded. Across this country, Black and Latinx students will enter high school having experienced eight years of under-resourced education. There will be a severe mismatch between where they and their peers arrive at school academically and what teachers are required to teach. Under-resourced schools that serve Black and Latinx students and disproportionately large populations of students experiencing poverty are unable to provide individualized education to students who are performing behind grade level. Even our nation's strongest teachers do not have the ability to consistently provide targeted, personalized instructional support.", "start_char_idx": 6, "end_char_idx": 4870, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7dcf7f88-0a5f-4beb-9a6e-3ae15eb13ce3": {"__data__": {"id_": "7dcf7f88-0a5f-4beb-9a6e-3ae15eb13ce3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/Context/FS_BM_action_plan.txt", "file_name": "FS_BM_action_plan.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 97159, "creation_date": "2024-06-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-23"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "90573a8c-6f7d-45fc-9c71-a3a23b6a4d8a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/Context/FS_BM_action_plan.txt", "file_name": "FS_BM_action_plan.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 97159, "creation_date": "2024-06-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-23"}, "hash": "4511c40bd323b4104d4511a0fcf853862002a40dc14754dcc8e4bd359368821d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8cb4fd94-1ff0-4e17-86fc-dce2aa8c23eb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/Context/FS_BM_action_plan.txt", "file_name": "FS_BM_action_plan.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 97159, "creation_date": "2024-06-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-23"}, "hash": "389ac69707a21bb01bfcb6b7f72b2ecde20dd643707ddeab54395f942789743c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0ec43081-ea66-4373-a2ce-0a0a4b219079", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "331c70b4e242680dc1a62e777cdf12c4b0e06b083c886dae583ce59b0430cb15", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "While most white students will attend a high school that offers calculus,\r\ntwo-thirds of Blacks will not.

There will be a severe mismatch between where they and their peers arrive at school academically and what teachers are required to teach. Under-resourced schools that serve Black and Latinx students and disproportionately large populations of students experiencing poverty are unable to provide individualized education to students who are performing behind grade level. Even our nation's strongest teachers do not have the ability to consistently provide targeted, personalized instructional support. Schools promote most students to the next grade level regardless of student skill level, which simply pushes the issue down the road and further compounds the disconnect between a student's level and what is being taught in their classroom. As a result, the Black and White opportunity gap progressively widens in America as students advance, with few ideas-let alone evidence-of what would work to close it. The picture appears bleak; the pandemic has made it more pronounced. There is a strategic leverage point and solution that will help to address this issue: X\u2019s model of tutoring for algebra.\r\nWe should listen to the students who are being most adversely affected by these structural challenges. 80% of students who dropout of high school cite course failures as their top reason and Algebra 1 is the course most failed. Only 20% of students who fail Algebra 1 in ninth grade will go on to receive a high school diploma, compared to 85% of those who pass the course. Because of this and the cascading consequences that include economic mobility, the late Bob Moses rightfully identified disparate racial outcomes in algebra as not just an issue in educational equality, but a civil rights issue. [1]\r\nX Co.has demonstrated that even at the high school level it is Not Too Late [3] to reverse the cumulative impacts of systemic racism in our education system. A single year of X\u2019s Algebra 1 intervention, delivered with careful attention to adhering to the standards of high-dosage tutoring that X Co.(and its predecessor, Match) originated and built upon, has been rigorously shown to drastically reduce the overall opportunity gap in mathematics (cutting one half the gap in one year), to improve performance in all academic subjects (cutting the class failure rate in math in half and in other subjects by more than 25%), and to improve high school graduation rates (reducing dropout rates by 25%). X Co.has demonstrated that embedding high-dosage tutoring into the school day, as part of the student's school schedule that complements their regular math course, is the most equitable way of providing tutoring. Students are already in school and are not forced to make the economic choice of receiving tutoring, working to support their family, or participating in extracurricular activities that compete for their time after school. Embedding tutoring into public schools extends it through the diversity of our society and can prioritize students who are experiencing poverty, who are disproportionately Black and Latinx. From our research, we know this gateway to high school graduation-passing Algebra 1-can be unlocked for students, and from our evidence, we know how to unlock it.\r\nThrough direct, frequent tutoring by an adult who is chosen for their ability to connect with youth, students are able to gain the foundational and prerequisite skills to access the Algebra 1 curriculum. Too few districts provide this type of personalization, and as a result we continue to watch generations of youth, disproportionately Black and Latinx,\r\n \r\n\r\nleft behind. If we get this right, the numbers of students we can affect are staggering: there are approximately four million students enrolled in Algebra 1 in US public schools, half of whom are at risk of failing Algebra 1 and thereby increasing their likelihood of dropping out of high school by a factor of four. We intend to lift the trajectory of one million students in Algebra 1 who attend high-poverty schools, most of whom are students of color. [4]\r\nThe challenge now is how to best and most rapidly scale this model while maintaining fidelity, efficacy, and impact not only in Algebra 1, but more broadly in middle years math and ultimately tutoring across the key leverage points in K-12 education (early literacy and middle-years math).\r\nVISION FOR IMPACT AT SCALE\r\nX\u2019s vision is for high-dosage tutoring to be a part of the fabric of America's public education system-in twenty districts by the end of the Action Plan, and in one hundred districts within ten years.", "start_char_idx": 3934, "end_char_idx": 8912, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0ec43081-ea66-4373-a2ce-0a0a4b219079": {"__data__": {"id_": "0ec43081-ea66-4373-a2ce-0a0a4b219079", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/Context/FS_BM_action_plan.txt", "file_name": "FS_BM_action_plan.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 97159, "creation_date": "2024-06-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-23"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "90573a8c-6f7d-45fc-9c71-a3a23b6a4d8a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/Context/FS_BM_action_plan.txt", "file_name": "FS_BM_action_plan.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 97159, "creation_date": "2024-06-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-23"}, "hash": "4511c40bd323b4104d4511a0fcf853862002a40dc14754dcc8e4bd359368821d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7dcf7f88-0a5f-4beb-9a6e-3ae15eb13ce3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/Context/FS_BM_action_plan.txt", "file_name": "FS_BM_action_plan.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 97159, "creation_date": "2024-06-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-23"}, "hash": "92568783937c3db7962dfbebe643e5241d462e01cc6b82a758cc15761f41b6f3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f89cc4ba-34da-4f48-93f9-c5bc30589244", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f240d85ca04bda74f7f230a28581bb3ee29c85449e61a8efca960db9b34bb7e3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "We intend to lift the trajectory of one million students in Algebra 1 who attend high-poverty schools, most of whom are students of color.

In this vision, personalized instruction will become a normal part of what a student could expect in their school day and, as a result, all students would reap the benefits of mastering middle grade mathematics (algebra proficiency by grade 9) and early literacy (reading proficiency by grade 3). This new education system would give students access to support that can catch up and accelerate their skills, thereby enabling students who are far behind to participate fully, at grade level, in their core classes. School schedules would reflect this integrated approach, teachers would be trained to collaborate with tutors, and there would be a new opportunity across the nation for educated, caring adults to serve as tutors and contribute to the pipeline of talent ready and able to serve students.\r\nX Co. envisions a world where K-12 students-especially low-income Black and Latinx students-have equitable access to economic and social mobility. To achieve this, X Co.seeks to establish high-dosage, in-school-day math tutoring (SHDT) as an integrated part of a student's\r\nK-12 education, a proven response to inequity, built to endure on the bedrock of public funding.\r\nEvidence clearly demonstrates that high school graduation is a critical determinant of economic mobility and that successful completion of Algebra 1 is a leading indicator for graduation. It also puts students on a pathway to Calculus by Grade 12, which puts them on a potential college path toward an engineering degree-and the potential of lucrative STEM-related job opportunities that can lead to additional economic mobility. The STEM workforce looks overwhelmingly white, with 66% of STEM workers with a bachelor's degree or higher who are white and just under 15% of STEM workers with a bachelor's degree or higher who are Black or Latinx. (NSF, National Science Board, August 2021). The world will look markedly different with Black and Latinx engineers as a significant part of the STEM workforce. [1]\r\nBy embedding X\u2019s proven approach to high-dosage tutoring into the school day (SHDT), the public education system can vastly improve outcomes in Algebra 1 and, ultimately, the long-term economic upward mobility of students experiencing poverty. [5]\r\nPROGRAM MODEL\r\nX Co. began as an evidence-based, personalized tutoring solution designed to support students who may be struggling with math or academics in general, to give them the confidence and academic strength to graduate high school, and continue to postsecondary pursuit of their dreams. X\u2019s motto, imbued with our organizational values, is that \"students don't care how much you know until they know how much you care.\"[6] Central to the success of X\u2019s proven program are these key components: 1) a relationship-based model with small group size for tutoring;\r\n2)\ttutors who are trained and provided ongoing support in X\u2019s instructional philosophy of addressing mathematical mindsets, collaborative learning, and critical thinking; and 3) the alignment of the tutoring curriculum and activities with each school's unique context and content sequence. High-quality tutoring is centered on a strong working relationship between the tutor and their students, with a tutor-to-student ratio of 1:2 or 1:3. In each school where X Co. provides its program directly, students attend a daily tutorial period each day, within the regular school day, where they work with their own tutor for personalized math instruction. That tutor is in turn trained and coached\r\n \r\n\r\nby a supervisor. This dedicated period during the school day is in addition to their regular math class. This enables X Co.to meet students where they are in their journey of making sense of math and in solidifying their confidence in and identity of a person who belongs in the math- learning and success space. It augments the work of the school's math teachers and provides a level of personalization that is not possible for a typical teacher's caseload. X Co. integrates into the school with close collaboration between the X Co. team site director and the key players at the school, so that X Co. becomes baked into the program.\r\nThis proven model is now being virtualized.

X Co. integrates into the school with close collaboration between the X Co. team site director and the key players at the school, so that X Co. becomes baked into the program.\r\nThis proven model is now being virtualized. In response to COVID, X Co. acquired a technology company that enabled a fully custom and optimized platform for integrated online tutoring. A free online basic training portal was released to the country (May 2021). Technology done well can and will open the door to rapidly scaling X\u2019s program across the nation.\r\nX Co. deploys two variants derived from its Traditional Model: a Blended Model in which students alternate days between working independently on an adaptive software platform and working with their tutor, and an Online model in which the Blended Model is delivered with tutors working remotely, online. The blended and online variants are the most cost effective in terms of student gains per student cost and are now the most common in X Co.cities (about 90% of the schools we serve). The online model has proven to be the most scalable.\r\nFor all versions of the model, tutors work with students during the regular course of a school day. Typically, this is for six periods a day. Tutors are identified from a diverse pool of applicants and chosen based on a dozen criteria, including, critically, their ability to connect with the youth X Co.serves. Encouragingly, year after year and city after city, 30-50 percent of tutors hired (and 70 percent of our school site supervisors) are Black or Latinx, providing valuable representation to the youth we serve. Our tutors overwhelmingly tend to stay for their entire year-long commitment, building trust with their students. Each school is overseen by a site director who handles issues of student focus in the tutoring room and communication with school staff, and provides daily feedback and ongoing coaching to the tutors. The tutors and site directors receive both pre-service and on-going training, delivered in recent years entirely online. Central to this training is a focus on effectively keeping students in the zone of proximal development and making sure that the ratio of student-to-tutor working, thinking, writing, and explaining is shifted in the direction of the students, causing the tutor to stay in the role of facilitator.\r\nCHANNEL FOR SCALE\r\nX\u2019s high-dosage, evidence-based model is the gold standard for math tutoring. Today, X Co.delivers its\r\nhigh-dosage tutoring program as a direct service to urban school districts serving disadvantaged youth. X Co.grew this direct service model from one school in NYC in 2015, serving 140 students, to 60 schools in 2021/22, serving 7000 students (Chicago, DC, NYC, Broward County FL, Charleston SC, Providence RI). Cumulatively, X Co.has been contracted by districts to serve nearly 30,000 students over the last seven years.\r\nToday, X Co.is seeking to develop a channel for scale that will allow its evidence-based approach generated in our direct service model (Engine 1) to rapidly reach the over one million disadvantaged youth enrolled in Algebra 1 who could greatly benefit from it each year [4], through our evidence-informed widespread impact model. These one million young people are at risk of failing Algebra 1 without the strong evidence-based intervention that X Co.has demonstrated since 2004 (including our years at our predecessor organization, Match Education); if they fail, 80% will drop out of high school. [2] While X\u2019s existing direct program will continue to scale, the rate at which it is able to add staffing and scale is limited to roughly 25% in year-over-year growth. X Co.has identified that the best path to more rapid scaling will be through school districts directly implementing their own versions of X\u2019s model, using X\u2019s support to ensure fidelity to the key elements of the model. X Co.has restructured around two engines for fidelity and growth. Engine 1 is our direct services program and model for fidelity, and Engine 2 is our wide-spread impact program and model for growth, as illustrated in Figure 1.", "start_char_idx": 12185, "end_char_idx": 16968, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5ef3e107-10fd-480e-a03e-f17121b57580": {"__data__": {"id_": "5ef3e107-10fd-480e-a03e-f17121b57580", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/Context/FS_BM_action_plan.txt", "file_name": "FS_BM_action_plan.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 97159, "creation_date": "2024-06-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-23"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "90573a8c-6f7d-45fc-9c71-a3a23b6a4d8a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/Context/FS_BM_action_plan.txt", "file_name": "FS_BM_action_plan.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 97159, "creation_date": "2024-06-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-23"}, "hash": "4511c40bd323b4104d4511a0fcf853862002a40dc14754dcc8e4bd359368821d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f89cc4ba-34da-4f48-93f9-c5bc30589244", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/Context/FS_BM_action_plan.txt", "file_name": "FS_BM_action_plan.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 97159, "creation_date": "2024-06-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-23"}, "hash": "421c4bde75434c4a5489776ebd697e7538879c7011808b58375bf93ecbe9f346", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0a2d338d-cb14-45bc-83d3-0bf7a497ac8e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "974a8dd3ee247cd572dba81a363a58348f4b8760e0c7aa8662a75321c4220548", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "These one million young people are at risk of failing Algebra 1 without the strong evidence-based intervention that X Co.has demonstrated since 2004 (including our years at our predecessor organization, Match Education); if they fail, 80% will drop out of high school.

X Co.has restructured around two engines for fidelity and growth. Engine 1 is our direct services program and model for fidelity, and Engine 2 is our wide-spread impact program and model for growth, as illustrated in Figure 1. These are not independent programs but mutually reinforcing efforts. While Engine 2 grows exponentially to serve far more students, Engine 1 will continue to deliver\r\n \r\n\r\nimportant learnings from its ongoing R&D; conversely, Engine 2 will contribute key learnings from new contexts as many districts work to implement and adapt the model to their local context.\r\nThis Action Plan focuses on the design and development of Engine 2 in order to meet its goals of rapid scalability and widespread impact. Over the next three years, we will test hypotheses that we believe will lead to the solutions that make it possible for districts to implement X\u2019s model with fidelity in the absence of X directly staffing and running these programs. The channel for testing these hypotheses already exists: over the past year, we have been engaged by multiple districts and states outside our direct service model to provide technical assistance to support their efforts to implement high-dosage, in-school tutoring programs. These engagements provide evidence and data to inform how we position and package our model for scale. In parallel, we have developed an online training program (X Co. Coach) under which X\u2019s effective in-person tutor training programs are codified and made asynchronous so as to be broadly available.\r\nOur goal is to serve sets of districts in a cohort model, so that they can co-design and learn from each other. These districts will share certain commitments but vary in characteristics. Each cohort of districts will be internally consistent: that is to say, large urban districts will be grouped together; medium-sized and suburban districts will be together; and rural will be its own cohort. Our focus on equity for under-served students will mean that we will focus each cohort on schools within those districts that are high-poverty and have 50% or more students of color. Over three years, we will bring district cohorts on board at different times. At the end of three years, this format will allow us to demonstrate the promise of X\u2019s proven model informing effective high-dosage tutoring models implemented by partner districts across the spectrum of US public school districts. Over the three year Action Plan period, as described in the \"3-Year Goal\" section below, we plan a reach of 20 districts and 184 schools that represent the scope of American, high-poverty, public schools (large urban; medium urban/suburban; rural). Entering the cohort will require districts to commit and conform to the basic elements of X\u2019s model illustrated in Figure 2.\r\nOver the three year action period, we anticipate that we will gradually transition the forms of support that we provide to districts in each cohort from more detailed and intensive support to more strategic support at the administrative level. Proving that we can make such a transition will be key to demonstrating the feasibility of this channel to scale. We hypothesize that we will initially be providing a level of support that is not scalable and that this support will be both broad and deep, related to supporting implementations and tutor training at the classroom level and intra-school coordination level. As we learn from our district partners who are implementing these programs (as co-design partners), we believe that we will be able to develop systems, processes, tools, and technology to make the work repeatable and scalable. As we do so, we expect that our engagements with school districts will transition to providing technical support at higher levels of the administrative structure and that this support will become less extensive and less expensive over time. Our belief is that at the end of three years, there will be considerable demand\r\n \r\n\r\nfor our services because of the success of our cohort districts, and momentum toward national expansion that builds on the current momentum in K-12 for learning acceleration and tutoring.\r\nFigure 2: Core Elements of X Co.\u2019s Model\r\nWhile we acknowledge that there are other players offering tutoring solutions to school districts, X Co.is already in a market-leading position.

No alternative solution has X\u2019s evidence base, and we set the standards for the tutoring of math in schools. The White House and the US Department of Education have highlighted X\u2019s evidence in both their materials accompanying the President's March 2022 State of the Union Address and their 2021 School Reopening Guidance. Engine 2 has the power to achieve equity, leveling the playing field for marginalized communities to have access to tutoring which typically is the domain of the well-off. In addition, on a parallel track, we will continue innovating in our Engine 1 core model and push out improvements to the field, and we will make organizational adaptations and continue to strengthen our internal capacity to support district partners.\r\nSUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC MODEL\r\nPublic funding is the way we want to both provide our direct services, and to grow our widespread impact services. We intend to demonstrate that a cost-effective model for in-school-day math tutoring can be delivered around $1,000 per pupil. This target is important, because it will be an annual amount below the federal Title I allocation per pupil (historically, before the stimulus bills of 2020-2021, about $1000 per pupil). Title I has been a steady source of funding to high-poverty districts for over 55 years. Districts will be able to rely on one single sustainable federal source for their programs. We believe that districts will build these programs into their budgets when they are convinced of their cost-effectiveness. And they will need X\u2019s assistance during the three years in our cohort to solve the myriad issues that will arise, including sourcing and supporting talent and changing schedules, for example.\r\nAs for the cost of running a successful tutoring program, currently, our average cost per pupil is about $1,900, but we have models in Broward County, FL and in Providence, RI that are under $1,300 per pupil under variations on our caseload and dosage models. We will run some pilots in Years 1-3 of the Action Plan to test variants on the model we now deliver in our direct service program. We will look to test changes in dosage, caseload, ratio of tutors to students in tutorials, the mix of labor to deliver tutoring, and the offloading of laborious processes to technology tools and AI. Districts in our cohort will benefit as X Co.innovates and tests variations in our model, as the closer we can get to\r\n$1000 per pupil, the easier this fits into district budgets (the typical large US public school district spends between\r\n$15,000 and $20,000 per year, per pupil, on operations overall).\r\nCurrently, X\u2019s direct program (Engine 1) is paid for by a combination of district funds (usually federal Title I dollars), federal subsidy through AmeriCorps, private philanthropy, and individual school contributions. To pay for tutoring now, districts for the next three years have even more funding from federal stimulus allocations (ARP, ESSER). Broad demand for X\u2019s offerings already exists. Our plan for Engine 2 is ultimately to fund the work\r\n \r\n\r\nthrough earned revenue, with districts paying us-again, likely using a part of their Title I allocation (or federal stimulus funds over the near term). First-year participation in a cohort will involve no additional cost for districts who are paying for X Co .services or tools; we hypothesize that making this portion of X\u2019s program free will remove administrative overheads and complications such as procurement processes. Before the end of the first year of each cohort, however, we will ask the districts to pay for continuing services in years two and three. We anticipate they will contribute financially in years 2 and 3, as they continue to receive philanthropic subsidy through X Co. during their three cohort years ( this diminishes over time).", "start_char_idx": 20163, "end_char_idx": 24905, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c7d02727-cd01-4366-a8be-f2f215a94c8c": {"__data__": {"id_": "c7d02727-cd01-4366-a8be-f2f215a94c8c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/Context/FS_BM_action_plan.txt", "file_name": "FS_BM_action_plan.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 97159, "creation_date": "2024-06-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-23"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "90573a8c-6f7d-45fc-9c71-a3a23b6a4d8a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/Context/FS_BM_action_plan.txt", "file_name": "FS_BM_action_plan.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 97159, "creation_date": "2024-06-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-23"}, "hash": "4511c40bd323b4104d4511a0fcf853862002a40dc14754dcc8e4bd359368821d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0a2d338d-cb14-45bc-83d3-0bf7a497ac8e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/Context/FS_BM_action_plan.txt", "file_name": "FS_BM_action_plan.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 97159, "creation_date": "2024-06-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-23"}, "hash": "3ddbab9ffc7d81e7db1163eaf86f03f5350ff4fd4e8ffb8c07b7900a7795dda3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "af811d58-57e2-4876-a569-9a872ef0c62d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "19646c06d070a8c83de64f91cbb7254f02b3a1a34b42227eff07cccb21fcf074", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Broad demand for X\u2019s offerings already exists.

We anticipate they will contribute financially in years 2 and 3, as they continue to receive philanthropic subsidy through X Co. during their three cohort years ( this diminishes over time). After they graduate, they do not receive philanthropic subsidy through X. Our hypothesis is that when they see evidence of X\u2019s effectiveness in pre-launch design and post-launch support, they will be willing to pay. We forecast significant revenue prior to the end of our three year plan (see Table 2 in that section), and this will increase in the year following the action plan, if we are successful. In that fourth year, we anticipate that we will be serving at least thirty districts and three hundred schools that will be contributing revenue on the order of $4.5 million, against direct costs on the order of $6.0 million for our supporting services (not including our forward-looking sales, marketing, and R&D). Economic sustainability on earned revenue alone could come as early as the third year following the action plan.\r\nThere is precedent: from 2013-2015, X Co. served Chicago Public Schools completely funded by philanthropy, at no cost to the district. Then, in 2015, the district Board of Education approved a four year contract for X, in which 85% of X\u2019s costs were covered by the district's Title I funds. In 2019, the district approved a renewal, for an additional six years, again with its own Title I funds. Similarly, in Washington DC, private philanthropy from the Clark Foundation started X\u2019s deployment in 2018. Then, in 2020, the District began to add a share, to replace private funds. Moreover, in 2021, individual DC schools also added a share to supplement the district's payments.\r\nInitial evidence of economic feasibility is also emerging from X\u2019s current technical assistance support work. For a New Mexico District, the state is paying X Co.$1,000 per month per school for support (for a total of $22,000 per month for 22 schools). California's Green Dot Public Charter network is paying $215 per tutorial video for X Co.to provide asynchronous tutorial observations and feedback (in which X Co.reviews video recordings of tutorials and debriefs with the Green Dot team each month to inform their tutor professional development programs).\r\nEVIDENCE OF EFFECTIVENESS\r\nX Co.is frequently cited for its substantial evidence of efficacy in the tutoring space for its direct program services. X\u2019s direct service Engine 1 math program has been involved in six randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of its tutoring model since 2013. A seventh RCT was done on X\u2019s direct service literacy program, which is not part of X\u2019s action plan for the next three years. Across these studies, X Co.has generated rigorous evidence of the substantial impact of high-impact tutoring on students' math performance. We have replicated these impacts across studies and demonstrate that these effects persist even when X Co.is implemented through more blended and scalable models. Collectively, this evidence base creates a strong foundation and motivation for the potential efficacy of our Engine 2 model at scale.\r\nSince the 2013-14 academic year, X Co.has implemented its tutoring model in grades nine and ten across the country. The University of Chicago Education Lab partnered with X Co.and the Chicago Public Schools, and the NYC Department of education, to carry out multiple large-scale, randomized controlled trials to understand X\u2019s impact on thousands of Chicago ninth and tenth graders in high-poverty schools. Our early evidence was very strong. That led us to ask more questions-including what are the specific mechanisms that led to these results; and can we change elements of our model to maintain effectiveness, while reducing costs?\r\n\u25cf\tResults of X\u2019s work in Chicago from 2013-14 (a large scale randomized controlled trial) show that one year of participation improved student math test scores by the equivalent of an extra one year of learning for the typical American high school student; put differently, the effect is close about one-fifth of the national Black-White test score gap in a single year, or one-sixth of a standard deviation (Reardon, 2011).", "start_char_idx": 24045, "end_char_idx": 28890, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "af811d58-57e2-4876-a569-9a872ef0c62d": {"__data__": {"id_": "af811d58-57e2-4876-a569-9a872ef0c62d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/Context/FS_BM_action_plan.txt", "file_name": "FS_BM_action_plan.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 97159, "creation_date": "2024-06-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-23"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "90573a8c-6f7d-45fc-9c71-a3a23b6a4d8a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/Context/FS_BM_action_plan.txt", "file_name": "FS_BM_action_plan.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 97159, "creation_date": "2024-06-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-23"}, "hash": "4511c40bd323b4104d4511a0fcf853862002a40dc14754dcc8e4bd359368821d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c7d02727-cd01-4366-a8be-f2f215a94c8c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/Context/FS_BM_action_plan.txt", "file_name": "FS_BM_action_plan.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 97159, "creation_date": "2024-06-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-23"}, "hash": "1a7c8bf80b1c90f3995a29d56384e99a5e3af6a4b9135632275a54c28edb05b1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f34d9709-2bd4-462e-a75d-5d8d10afdc1b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "38f39ac451cc184fea64a5bd5036d00349729f31beda3888d4ae1bc60f7e5994", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The University of Chicago Education Lab partnered with X Co.and the Chicago Public Schools, and the NYC Department of education, to carry out multiple large-scale, randomized controlled trials to understand X\u2019s impact on thousands of Chicago ninth and tenth graders in high-poverty schools.

Programming during these years also improved math GPA by 0.4 to 0.6 points on a four-point scale, reduced math course failures by 45-60%, and reduced non-math course failures by over 25%. Moreover, there was a suggested 25% reduction in the HS dropout rate (and a 25% or greater increase in the graduation rate), but the data was not yet robust enough to make this last finding statistically significant.\r\n\u25cf\tA third RCT study in 2015-16 found a statistically significant increase of 0.86 points on math GPA, although implementation barriers in Chicago limited some of the findings from this study.\r\n\u25cf\tA fourth and fifth RCT study was done of X\u2019s blended model. This was a modification of our design and in the tutor student caseload-a model at 60% of the cost of our initial model. In this model, tutors had four students assigned to them per period; they tutored two \"live,\" while the other two worked on an adaptive practice platform. Students alternated in these modes every other day. For study year one, the U of Chicago reported statistically significant positive effects on math test scores and math course GPA, as well as a decrease in math course failures. More specifically, UC observed an improvement of 0.24 standard deviations on math test scores (1-2 additional years of math learning), an increase of 0.21 points on math course GPA, and a decrease of 20% on math course failures. These findings are on par with the results from the initial study of X\u2019s 2-to-1, non-blended tutoring model in 2013-15. I.e., the blended model was found to be nearly twice as cost-effective as the non-blended model.\r\n\u25cf\tA sixth randomized controlled trial was conducted by NORC, of X\u2019s online tutoring for the SAT. It, too, showed strong impacts on student SAT math scores (0.41 standard deviations).\r\nIn addition, X\u2019s technical assistance work has also been evaluated in several locations. Details on this are in Note [7]. The early evidence strongly promises that X\u2019s expansion into Engine 2 support for districts will be successful.\r\nRACIAL EQUITY\r\nX\u2019s existential mission is to help eliminate the systemic racism that has resulted in Black and Latinx students not having equal access to a quality education. From its founding, X Co. has chosen to work with districts where the student population being served has been over 80 percent (and in some years and schools, 90-100 percent) Black and Latinx.\r\nIn order to ensure that its programs would in fact reach these populations, X Co.  made the unprecedented decision that its high-dosage tutoring program would be designed into the regular day of public schools in America-it hadn't happened before. This is a critical element as we strive to nationally and systemically deliver on our mission to address today's inequity in education.\r\nTypically, people think of tutoring as an after-school activity. However, much of the tutoring that occurs after school is an afterthought, for the school, the teachers, and even for the students. After-school tutors come to a scheduled session, not knowing that their student didn't attend school that day, or not knowing their student had a conflict after school with other commitments (extracurricular, family, job).

After-school tutoring doesn't connect with teachers, and the tutors don't connect with the teachers' scope and sequence or share timely performance data. For students experiencing poverty, who are disproportionately Black and Latinx in the U.S., tutoring after school or out of school time would have been the least equitable option. In-school tutoring does not compete with family, extracurriculars, job conflicts, or transportation limitations; it is the most equitable placement for tutoring to be scheduled.\r\nInternally, X Co. has a Board committee established to support the organization in our DEIB work. Our goals are to have an organization in which all individual team members feel a strong sense of belonging, a goal which can be supported by effective diversity, equity and inclusion work. We administer the 12 question Gallup poll measuring individual needs, feelings of belonging and support, and disaggregate the data by race, gender, and other identities.\r\n \r\n\r\nWe review the data, hold focus groups to flesh out narratives, and take actions as a result. We have an internal task force of interested staff and tutors that meets monthly to promote DEIB initiatives.\r\nX\u2019s widespread impact channel will be focused on high-poverty schools in the same way that X\u2019s direct impact channel has focused on these schools, and the students of color that these schools disproportionately serve. We anticipate that this focus on high-poverty schools will be naturally supported by districts because of the alignment with the availability of Title I funding. (Should the availability of Title I funding not create sufficient alignment with X\u2019s goal of focusing on racial equity and high-poverty schools, then we will additionally incentivize alignment through needs-based discounting of our tools and services.) In order to effectively serve students of color we will continue to co-design our tools and materials with our direct-service students (at least 80 percent of whom are Black or Latinx). This includes our math curriculum which was designed with the students and the tutoring process in mind. It also includes new developments, like our adaptive practice tool, which seek to super-serve these students.\r\n3-\tYEAR GOAL\r\nWe hypothesize that certain human-powered and technology-supported systems will unlock the channel for scale that we described above. Over the next three years, we plan to demonstrate that these systems can be built out and that they will make it possible for school districts to conform to X\u2019s high-dosage approach scalably (and therefore largely independently), while maintaining fidelity. The primary three-year goal is to surface and test all of the critical hypotheses that underpin the channel for scale. Figure 3 illustrates the key hypotheses in this model as we currently conceive them; all are important, though we assume that the model itself will evolve as elements are tested and new systems are co-designed with district partners. What will be true at the end of three years is that districts will have seen the value of each of these actions, and will be paying for X\u2019s services as a cost-effective addition to their budget for personnel delivering tutoring in their schools.\r\nFigure 3: Hypotheses Supporting X Co.\u2019s Channel for Scale\r\nHypothesis 1 (H1): Demand for X\u2019s Technical Assistance Services Will Enable Its District Cohort Model\r\nOur action plan builds off the fact that there is an existing strong demand for our technical assistance and quality assurance services. We have won competitive contracts in New Mexico and Chicago in 2021 and 2022, and competitive awards from Rhode Island and Maryland are anticipated shortly. We anticipate that this demand will be sustained in the market given the substantial Federal funding flows towards tutoring and related shifts in awareness about tutoring programs.

In addition to proving the market demand hypothesis (and hence continuously verifying product-market fit), the cohort model will provide us with customers to test other hypotheses in the model both longitudinally (as districts become more comfortable with the\r\n \r\n\r\ntutoring programs and expand their programs) and iteratively (as new districts join new cohorts each year). Critically, a subset of district cohorts will also be recruited as co-design partners.\r\nThe output of the co-design process will be a set of tools and resources (described below) that enable and support SHDT at scale. Having been co-designed to meet the needs of a diversity of districts (all serving historically disadvantaged students in high-poverty contexts), we hypothesize that these tools will lower X\u2019s per-unit cost for support. We also hypothesize that these tools will reduce district overhead costs, improve the cost efficiency of their programs (i.e., deliver better outcomes for historically disadvantaged students relative to the per-student cost of the programs), and increase the demand for new districts adopting the program.\r\nFigure 4: X Co.\u2019s High-Dosage Tutoring Cohort Model\r\nWe will invite districts to join X Co.in cohorts. Cohort 1 will have four districts; Cohort 2 and 3, each starting a year later, will add at least eight additional districts, as will Cohorts 4 and 5, each starting 2 years after Cohort 1. Through this ramping up of the cohort model we will explicitly test our ability to scale Engine 2 to serve many districts. Our goal in year three is to have twenty districts participating concurrently. At the end of this period, our first cohort of four districts will be graduating.

It should also help to position the cohort model as a mutually beneficial way for districts to learn from each other and for us to learn from the districts and to co-design tools and systems that better serve everyone in the SHDT ecosystem.

Areas where we are already planning such improvements include:\r\n1.\tIntegrated Tutor Training - Extending our existing platform for tutor training to include pathways for training that are cohort based and allow tutors to connect with others, role play, and practice mock tutorials.\r\n2.\tMath Curriculum Training - Extending our existing platform to support training on X\u2019s math curriculum.\r\n3.\tVideo Submission Options - Incorporating video submissions into our platform as a way to assess tutors understanding and provide high-value feedback.\r\nWe also hypothesize that the a la carte Technical Assistance and Quality Assurance offerings during this three year period will have natural variations in district adoptions that will allow us to explore tradeoffs between fidelity and scalability / adoptability.

This technology promises to significantly reduce the time associated with Site Director review of tutorials for feedback and coaching purposes. The Site Director position currently adds a per pupil cost of $400 to $500 in X\u2019s programs. Therefore, if the AI for tutor feedback is in place, then the cost of replicating X\u2019s model by districts will decline, thereby increasing the probability that it can be sustained in\r\npost-federal-stimulus years. See Note [9] for additional details.\r\nBased on three years of experience co-designing technology specifically to support SHDT, Figure 5 is a block diagram of the systems we will pilot with District Cohort 1. While we believe this is a solid starting framework, we will continue to co-design the new elements of this system with students from historically marginalized schools.\r\nThese systems integrate with and augment existing district infrastructure and applications with new tutoring-specific capabilities.\r\nFrom this experience we are confident that the platform supporting blended tutoring will be the central component of these tools. We expect that this platform will be critical to both the online and in-person models, and we envision enhancing the in-person tutorials to seamlessly blend aspects of online and in-person through this platform.\r\nImportantly, we believe that this program will support future district-run programs that are much like the in-person model we have deployed to date, but with considerable technological enhancements to be built and with an online integration that we now lack.\r\nThrough the pandemic, we have seen the advantage of tutors being able to work remotely and live in areas that are sustainable at a service-level salary. These advantages of online tutoring make us believe, strongly, that online tutoring will remain prevalent in SHDT models going forward. Today, however, online tutoring, even when done well, currently feels too impersonal (much like Zoom meetings). Even in X\u2019s online tutoring platform (X Co. Connect), which provides many more interactive and engaging elements, the type of deep engagement that we observe during in-person tutoring-the laughter, high-fives, and camaraderie-is not yet present in today's online model. Contrast this with in-person classroom tutoring, which is energetic, engaging, and even slightly chaotic.\r\nX\u2019s next generation platform for tutoring will provide new and exciting ways for tutors and students to connect\r\n \r\n\r\nonline, bringing the best of 'classroom chaos' into the online space to further build and encourage relationship- and confidence-building in mathematics.\r\nWe know that the personal connection between tutors and students-the relationships that develop through shared experiences-are essential to X\u2019s model. As such, we consider it crucial to make further investment in the online tutoring experience in order to make it as engaging as the in-person experience. We have done an initial review of state-of-the-art online tutoring technologies and believe we can do just that. Four dimensions that we hypothesize will be most important to address are: a sense of belonging, a sense of a common group, and a meaningful incentive system for youth. We are actively co-designing systems to address these concerns.[10]\r\nH3: The Co-Designed Tools and Systems for SHDT Will Enable Broader and More Scalable Adoption of X\u2019s Technical Assistance Services\r\nWe believe that the tools and systems that we develop through this co-design process will in turn drive improvements to our ability to deliver effective technical assistance efficiently. In the model presented in Figure 2, the first three hypotheses together form a feedback loop of continuous improvement. We believe that this continuous improvement mechanism will help to unlock the channel for scale.\r\nWe know that we cannot serve all school districts in the country, and X\u2019s widespread impact will only be possible when other organizations and school districts can adopt and implement SHDT with fidelity.

In this expanded version, we will support both synchronous (live training) and asynchronous (independent learning.) It will provide training specific for the needs of the tutor, but also district administration, teachers, and supervisor, and enables cohorts of tutors to be able to role-play lessons and share learnings and more. As learners move through the program, they will be rewarded for their efforts, foster their identity and participate in real-time communication with peers and experts. Furthermore, the modules will be designed to support customization of the scope and sequence to by districts and third party organizations.\r\n \r\n\r\nH4: A Sustainable Community of Practice Will Emerge From the District Cohort Model\r\nMuch of our work with the District Cohort Model, as described above, is intended to facilitate the development of a community of practice that will be self-sustaining even as the model scales to more districts and X\u2019s direct support for each participating district decreases over time. As described in Figure 5, the expectation is that districts will be able to operate their SHDT programs largely independently by year three. However, through their three years of participation in a cohort with other district leadership teams, they will have built internal capacity and internalized knowledge on a range of key topics. They will have learned through X\u2019s facilitation and interactions with their peers to monitor and respond to key performance indicators for their SHDT programs, and will have adopted their own strategies for continuous improvement relative to these indicators. All of this should result in coherence and alignment across the districts in the cohort.\r\nThis alignment together with the relationships that will have been built across the districts through their participation in the program should produce the hypothesized, sustainable community of practice.\r\nH5: Through the Community of Practice and the Co-Designed Tools, Practices, and Resources, DNA that Encodes X\u2019s High-Dosage Tutoring Model Will Be Infused Into the Community of Practitioners\r\nThe ultimate goal of this Action Plan is to establish a repeatable and reliable mechanism by which X\u2019s practices for HDT are transmitted to new generations of HDT. We are using DNA as an analogy of how key advantageous traits are conveyed to new generations and also remain stable when implemented. We hypothesize that it will be the community of practice and the set of supporting tools, practices, and resources that encode and infuse X\u2019s\r\nHigh-Dosage Tutoring Model. We do not know precisely what this encoding will look like, but we expect it will emerge from the collaborative design work done with the districts and the interactions and learnings from the cohort model and the community of practice.

As a success baseline for this effort, we expect at a minimum to see that the districts will be exhibiting all of the core elements of X\u2019s model as shown in Figure 2, and that these elements will all appear to be stable and sustainable in their adoption of SHDT.\r\nWhat Needs to Be Proven True\r\nDuring this three-year plan, we do not believe that all of these hypotheses will need to be proven true (or, indeed, that none of these hypotheses will change), however, we do view the following set of outcomes as being essential to this Action Plans and our plans for effective and economically sustainable impact at full scale. First, we believe that we must establish a viable channel for recruiting districts into the model (which we conceptualize as H1). Second, we believe that we must find a viable pathway to working with a sufficient number of districts as co-design partners (for which we believe the cohort model and H2 are most promising). Third, a sustainable community of practice must emerge. And fourth most essentially, DNA encoding X\u2019s high-dosage tutoring model must be infused into the community of practitioners.\r\nSUCCESS METRICS\r\nThe indicators that we will use to evaluate our channel for impact-at-scale are primarily focused on the cohort of school districts in year one (the pilot cohort) and year two (the follow-on cohort). The key areas to measure are 1) fidelity of implementation (output measure); and 2) impact on student outcomes (outcomes measure). We will focus our learning on further evidence building in the categories below:\r\n\u25cb\tDo the participating cohort school districts implement the critical elements of SHDT listed below? With what fidelity? These questions will be revisited iteratively, with each cohort, as they gain experience with the\r\n \r\n\r\nmodel and elements and as we refine and expand the supporting structures, systems, and platforms based on the experience and input of the cohort districts as they work with us as co-designers.\r\n1.\tThe tutoring model, as implemented, matches the design parameters of the X Co.Model that are essential elements of SHDT: tutoring is provided in small groups (2-3 students); tutoring is provided 3-5 times per week, student-tutor pairings are maintained longitudinally; students receive at least 30 hours of personalized tutoring per semester; and the tutoring is implemented during the school day.\r\n2.\tThe tutoring is supplemental to core academic instruction (and not considered a replacement).\r\n3.\tThe tutoring curriculum is aligned with classroom instruction, and the curricula are coherent.\r\n4.\tTutoring is data-driven, with regular formative assessments to inform instructional approaches for students\r\n5.\tTutors receive adequate and effective pre-service training.\r\n6.\tTutors receive ongoing and effective in-service coaching, including frequent observation and feedback.\r\nMeasures of (incremental) success that will be used throughout the Action Plan period include: :\r\n\u25cb\tAre leading indicators for those gains in alignment with those seen in X-run programs?\r\nThese are the model alignment structures described above, and we will see this on day one of tutoring.\r\n\u25cb\tDo pre- and post- testing of academic gains match the gains that are seen in X-run programs?\r\n\u25cb\tDo measures of tutor engagement, student engagement, and student-tutor alliance align with what is seen in X-run programs?\r\nX Co. will develop qualitative and quantitative measurement plans to track the progress of district models as the districts progress through the cohort program. These plans will be designed to formatively guide the work of implementation and also to generate case studies that can be used to guide future cohorts and to inspire future work.

The Urban Labs of the University of Chicago has now applied for a federal IES grant to evaluate X\u2019s widespread work in Chicago Public Schools.\r\nIn parallel with these programmatic measures, we will apply a set of measures to study our investments in technology-supported tutoring. Central to this part of evaluation is evaluating how useful and usable the tools, platforms and online resources are for District-supported SHDT, and how they impact the feasibility of these district-supported models. We expect to see early indicators leading toward growing evidence of the efficacy of Engine 2. We'll start measuring implementation, partner engagement, tutor quality, district fidelity to our\r\nstandards--how similar does Engine 2 compare to Engine 1 on tutor background, measures of engaging students, etc. If these results are being shown, then there should be a waiting list of districts by the end of Year 3 that are eager to hire X Co and to use X\u2019s products. If tutoring is succeeding, then we should see districts working to change their approach to budgeting, scheduling, and deploying human capital so that tutoring is established as a regular component of students' school days. We may do some \"lean tests\" to see, of 100 districts invited to join Cohort 1, at x price, how many do join (we have discussed with Spring Impact, and will retain that firm, as our consultant for key periods during the three years of the Action Plan).\r\nData from these various measurements will enable us to quickly assess whether this new channel 1) replicates the essence of our Direct Impact model and 2) provides the scalability we are seeking. This plan is grounded in our long experience running HDT and our experience over the last two years in supporting districts through technical services and online resources. Building on this strong foundation, we are optimistic that transformative change is achievable over the next decade. Milestones along the way will give us confidence that X\u2019s model will scale-these milestones rest on the number of districts that adopt our model, and their fidelity to it.\r\n \r\n\r\nSuccess Metrics at the End of Year Three\r\nAt the end of three years we hope to prove success under the three following key metrics that will demonstrate a clear channel for scaling X\u2019s High-Dosage Tutoring model nationally:\r\n1.\tEvidence that there is broad and continuing demand for SHDT from districts. This evidence will come in the form of demand for our technical services sufficient to fill at least three new cohorts and ideally an additional four cohorts in the year following the conclusion of this Action Plan.\r\n2.\tEvidence that districts are willing to pay for the SHDT programs and support at a level that will lead to economic sustainability for Engine 2. This should also include evidence that the districts have a sustainable way to make those payments going forward, with (ideally) the funding becoming built into their operating budget and/or relying on stable public funding sources such as Title I.\r\n3.\tEvidence that the SHDT model is being implemented with fidelity (i.e. under the various metrics described above), particularly along dimensions theorized to be strongly coupled to student outcomes (such as the alliance between tutor their students, student sense of belonging in mathematics, confidence, perseverance, growth mindset, etc.).\r\nAt the end of year three, if we have met these metrics then we will know that we are on the right path - a path that leads to transformative change across our nation.\r\nTEST THE PATHWAY\r\nX\u2019s Engine 2 is designed to open a new channel, a channel for scale. While based on an existing model, this new channel represents an unproven approach based on a number of assumptions. As part of our effort in identifying risks, Bridgespan was retained by X Co. and conducted field research and those findings are folded into this summary, and our mitigation strategies are identified:\r\n\u25cb\tModel Risk (Impact) - Watering down of the high-dosage brand: If tutoring solutions scale without adequate controls and fidelity monitoring, effectiveness may be curbed, leading to less long-term support for tutoring as part of the standard educational model.

As part of our effort in identifying risks, Bridgespan was retained by X Co. and conducted field research and those findings are folded into this summary, and our mitigation strategies are identified:\r\n\u25cb\tModel Risk (Impact) - Watering down of the high-dosage brand: If tutoring solutions scale without adequate controls and fidelity monitoring, effectiveness may be curbed, leading to less long-term support for tutoring as part of the standard educational model. X Co. will push against this by becoming recognized as the brand leader for high impact tutoring.\r\n\u25cb\tModel Risk (Channel) - District leaders have a mismatched mindset regarding tutoring, what it means, how it works, and what's needed to implement it. X Co. will roll out a strategy to educate district leaders on effective tutoring, working with others as well.\r\n\u25cb\tModel Risk (Channel) - A direct service model may still be more attractive: Systems may continue to opt for direct service models, which are more plentiful, lead to immediate implementation, and keep long-term personnel costs low (with tutors employed by the provider). X Co. will not be able to stop districts from seeking direct providers, but will work most closely with our cohorts to train districts to do the work themselves after three years of cohort participation.\r\n\u25cb\tMarket Risk - Short-term momentum wanes: COVID has put learning loss top of mind, but commitment could wane as systems return to \"normal\" and sun-setting federal supports create a funding cliff. X Co. will work with others to raise public awareness of the success of high quality tutoring.\r\n\u25cb\tOperational Risk - A district is not ready after a year to graduate to the next level. X Co. will create alternate pathways for districts to proceed.\r\n\u25cb\tOperational Risk - Staffing capacity: If current labor market trends persist, districts may lack the capacity to execute on new programs and/or may lack the ability to recruit high-quality program managers and tutors. X Co. will continue to demonstrate that sourcing tutors remotely is most effective.\r\n\u25cb\tEconomic Risk - Districts are not willing to pay $100.00/per student/per year to participate in a cohort over three years to ultimately learn to run SHDT on their own. X Co. has some indication from our work this Spring in Chicago Public Schools, and in New Mexico (both entities issued RFPs and X Co. was awarded the grades 6-12 math trusted partnership role), that districts will pay this amount, but that assumption poses a\r\n \r\n\r\nrisk to our success.\r\n\u25cb\tEconomic Risk-Districts may have other ideas for their stimulus and Title I funds.

The Hamilton Project-Brookings.\r\n[4]\tOne million students\r\nWe target the population of just over one million students annually who take Algebra 1 in a high poverty public school, defined by the U.S. Department of Education as a school in which 75% to 100% of the students are on a free or reduced price lunch program. The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) reports that 24% of all public school students attend a high poverty school and that these students are disproportionately students of color (see the annual NCES report \"Concentration of Public School Students Eligible for Free or Reduced-Price Lunch,\" https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator/clb). Forty-five percent of all Black and Latinx students attend a high poverty school and seventy percent attend either a mid-to-high or high poverty school (i.e. a school in which the majority of students are FRPL), and as previously discussed in this Action Plan, those schools are also disproportionately under funded and under resourced. With 4.2 million ninth grade students currently enrolled in public schools (source: NCES) and Algebra 1 most often being covered in ninth grade, there are approximately 0.24 x 4.2M = 1.0M students currently taking Algebra 1 in a high-poverty public school in the U.S. While there are other ways to look at the numbers and to arrive at a similarly sized population of one million priority students, we prefer this school-based approach because SHDT programs are ideally implemented on a school-wide basis. School-wide implementations of SHDT reduce concerns related to students receiving tutoring and recast it not as a form of remediation but simply a service that all students receive.\r\n \r\n\r\n[5]\tVastly improved outcomes\r\nThere are two leverage points in K-12 education where the greatest gains can be garnered from student success, and where research shows the greatest gains will be had from effective interventions: reading proficiency by grade 3, and passing Algebra 1 by grade nine. Longitudinal research shows that students who achieve reading proficiency by grade three will graduate from high school nine years later at a four times higher rate than students who are not proficient in reading by grade three. Identically, students who pass Algebra 1 have a four times higher graduation rate than students who fail Algebra 1. Also, a meta-study by Roland Fryer published in 2016,1 of 196 RCTs of interventions in math and reading across age levels, shows higher effectiveness for reading interventions in lower grades versus middle or high school; and generally higher effects for late interventions in math versus interventions in math at earlier grades (graph on page 105); of special interest is that the strong X Co.results from Chicago in\r\n2013-2015 were not yet published, so were not in Dr.", "start_char_idx": 69139, "end_char_idx": 73554, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0ef71318-24ae-4064-a797-b6778a1e46a8": {"__data__": {"id_": "0ef71318-24ae-4064-a797-b6778a1e46a8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/Context/FS_BM_action_plan.txt", "file_name": "FS_BM_action_plan.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 97159, "creation_date": "2024-06-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-23"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "90573a8c-6f7d-45fc-9c71-a3a23b6a4d8a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/Context/FS_BM_action_plan.txt", "file_name": "FS_BM_action_plan.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 97159, "creation_date": "2024-06-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-23"}, "hash": "4511c40bd323b4104d4511a0fcf853862002a40dc14754dcc8e4bd359368821d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "db9cc69a-4960-4b46-89e8-0eeaa0d907f7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/Context/FS_BM_action_plan.txt", "file_name": "FS_BM_action_plan.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 97159, "creation_date": "2024-06-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-23"}, "hash": "dc7cd8b203f38436434bacba7f12985c0b9bd51ac55d8ce8d903f1876fd8457f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ff1a098d-ce97-45cf-a8be-9e604a0b47bb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5630d24e6074e2e7d3c7e83254c68440b0fc0384c37aae98fa03e5c4b80f9ac1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Longitudinal research shows that students who achieve reading proficiency by grade three will graduate from high school nine years later at a four times higher rate than students who are not proficient in reading by grade three.

Students who complete algebra by 8th grade attend college at higher rates than students who do not complete algebra.2 According to the U.S. Department of Education, 80 percent of high school dropouts cited their inability to pass Algebra 1 as the main reason for leaving school.3\r\n\u25cb\tCompleting algebra early has a positive impact on highly mobile career trajectories.4 The earlier that students are able to complete algebra, the earlier they are able to move on to more advanced math coursework. This has strong implications for career trajectory, particularly the ability to pursue STEM majors in college.\r\n\u25cb\tStrong high school math accomplishment helps students avoid remedial coursework in college. Between 60 and 70 percent of entering freshmen in community colleges enroll in remedial coursework, with the majority of these students needing remediation in math. 40 percent of students in remedial courses at two-year colleges and 25 percent of students in four-year colleges do not complete their degree.\r\n[6]\tX Co.\u2019s origin and the evolution of X\u2019s program model\r\nX Co. was founded as a nonprofit in 2014. It was spun off from Match Education, where Alan Safran, X\u2019s co-founder, helped coin the phrase \"high dosage tutoring\" and began an in-school-day tutoring program in 2004. In the first class of students to receive the tutoring was AJ Gutierrez, who later joined Alan Safran in\r\nco-founding X. Our first X Co.client was a high school in NYC where we served a group of 140 ninth graders. Prior to our inception, X\u2019s co-founders had been doing this work under the Match Education umbrella, in 2012 in Lawrence, MA, in 2013 in Stamford, CT, and from 2013-2015 as a pilot project funded by philanthropy in Chicago Public Schools. As principals and school leaders in Chicago witnessed the program's success during the 2013-2014 school year, three more schools adopted the program in the 2014-2015 school year. As a result, we served a much larger population in that first CPS pilot than anticipated and the program continued to expand across the district, ultimately becoming a part of the district's annual budget in 2015 to the present.\r\nToday, X Co.delivers its tutoring intervention in multiple models that all share a core set of practices. Tutors are selected from a pool of applicants, 85% of whom are recent college graduates (a few are associates degree holders), 10% of whom are mid-career switchers, and 5% of whom are retirees.

Each tutor participates in pre-service training. Students-as part of their regular class\r\nschedule-are assigned to participate in a tutoring session for one class period every day in addition to their regular math class (or a long period every other day, in schools with block scheduling). Tutors work six periods a day, and each school is overseen by a site director who handles issues of student focus in the tutoring room and communication with school staff, and provides daily feedback and ongoing coaching and professional development to the tutors. X Co.has created its own curriculum that all tutors use.\r\nEach tutorial session has 2-3 students assigned to work live with their tutor who (in the blended model, in which tutors have two or three live, two or three additional students \"assigned\" to the tutor actually work on a math platform nearby, separate from the live tutorial). l follows a set routine. A student first does four to five minutes of warm-up problems before receiving 40 minutes of tutoring on material tailored to that student. Finally, the student completes one to three problems designed to assess understanding of the material covered during the class period. Frequent internal formative assessments of student progress are used to individualize instruction. In addition, X Co.site directors work with mathematics teachers on a weekly basis to understand what standards are being taught in mainstream math classes so the X Co.tutorial covers complementary concepts. X Co.tutors also discuss general study skills with students as part of the formal program (such as structuring how to approach a difficult problem by breaking it down), as well as through informal discussions. High-quality tutoring is the science and art of giving excellent directions and asking great questions in the right order, while anticipating student answers and misconceptions along the way. High-quality tutoring keeps students in the zone of proximal development; this means that the ratio of student-to-tutor working, thinking, writing, and explaining is shifted in the direction of the students, causing the tutor to stay in the role of facilitator. High-quality tutoring is centered on a strong working relationship between the tutor and his/her students. X\u2019s motto, imbued with our organizational values, is that \"students don't care how much you know until they know how much you care.\" This is a critical component for Black and Latinx students as a way to begin to eradicate the school to prison pipeline happening in urban schools.\r\nThe key insight behind the specific educational intervention we study here, developed by X Co., is that being a successful tutor requires fewer specialized skills and less on-the-job learning than a classroom teacher. This insight expands the applicant pool, and also means that the people hired-tutors-can be successful right away (rather than the usual three year learning curve for classroom teachers ). X Co.therefore uses a very different HR model from regular education: It hires people to tutor for just one year for a modest stipend, as a sort of public service.\r\n[7]\tEvidence of effectiveness of X\u2019s Engine 1 (direct services) and Engine 2 (technical assistance/quality assurance consulting work):\r\na)\tEngine 1:\r\n\u25cb\tIn randomized controlled trials, researchers at the University of Chicago found that students who participated in X Co. tutoring can double or even triple the amount of math students learn in a single year.\r\n\u25cb\tX Co. has reduced disparities in grades and test scores between students from higher and lower income families by 50 percent.\r\n\u25cb\tParticipants' likelihood of failing math courses fell by as much as 63 percent.\r\n\u25cb\tCourse failures in non-tutored subjects have been reduced by as much as 26 percent.\r\n\u25cb\tStudent attendance among X Co.students has improved by as much as 18 days per year.\r\n\r\nb)\tEngine 2: Evidence on effectiveness of X\u2019s Technical Assistance and Quality Assurance\r\nThe strong evidence from Engine 1 (some was generated at Match HS in Boston before X Co.was founded in 2014) generated three successful consultancies (Houston, Netherlands, Providence RI).", "start_char_idx": 76419, "end_char_idx": 81255, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c7b2db04-f716-4903-bb70-91ef86c53200": {"__data__": {"id_": "c7b2db04-f716-4903-bb70-91ef86c53200", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/Context/FS_BM_action_plan.txt", "file_name": "FS_BM_action_plan.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 97159, "creation_date": "2024-06-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-23"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "90573a8c-6f7d-45fc-9c71-a3a23b6a4d8a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/Context/FS_BM_action_plan.txt", "file_name": "FS_BM_action_plan.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 97159, "creation_date": "2024-06-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-23"}, "hash": "4511c40bd323b4104d4511a0fcf853862002a40dc14754dcc8e4bd359368821d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ff1a098d-ce97-45cf-a8be-9e604a0b47bb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/Context/FS_BM_action_plan.txt", "file_name": "FS_BM_action_plan.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 97159, "creation_date": "2024-06-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-23"}, "hash": "56680369773546d033bc4ea94db9b2772b28e0f89937889ce833338cf0156abb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ee3a29bb-52f9-460a-a963-0d6f6adeaa1a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c49626ba1fe965edc9c3df0ffb0bda6ee850807ce49dca5208ccd6b09a9c41d7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "tutoring can double or even triple the amount of math students learn in a single year.\r\n\u25cb\tX Co. has reduced disparities in grades and test scores between students from higher and lower income families by 50 percent.\r\n\u25cb\tParticipants' likelihood of failing math courses fell by as much as 63 percent.\r\n\u25cb\tCourse failures in non-tutored subjects have been reduced by as much as 26 percent.\r\n\u25cb\tStudent attendance among X Co.students has improved by as much as 18 days per year.\r\n\r\nb)\tEngine 2: Evidence on effectiveness of X\u2019s Technical Assistance and Quality Assurance\r\nThe strong evidence from Engine 1 (some was generated at Match HS in Boston before X Co.was founded in 2014) generated three successful consultancies (Houston, Netherlands, Providence RI). Three of the consultancies demonstrate that our pathway to scale through widespread consulting is not only possible to\r\n \r\n\r\nexecute-it can achieve strong results; one consultancy (Pittsburgh) shows that key parameters must be maintained.\r\n\r\n(i) Houston (2010-2011)\r\nIn 2010, Harvard Professor Roland Fryer was hired by the Houston Independent School District, the seventh largest in the US, to manage five interventions in the twenty lowest performing schools there. He asked Match to manage one of the five-high dosage math tutoring-in sixth and ninth graders in those twenty sites. Match, which is where high-dosage tutoring began in 2004, was brought in to design and execute the selection process for tutors, train 250 tutors, and provide on-site support for the first month of the school year for tutor supervisors. Match provided tools, including sharing Match's tutorial materials with the curriculum director they hired and working closely with her to guide the use of the materials. As a result of the intervention, Dr. Fryer reported that the most effective of the five interventions was the high-dosage math tutoring. The Match team that managed the Houston consulting project included Alan Safran, who subsequently co-founded X; and Cathryn Cook, who subsequently joined X Co.as senior director of data and analytics.\r\n\r\n(ii)\tNetherlands (2015-present)\r\nBeginning in 2015, X\u2019s co-founders began a consulting project in the Netherlands. In 2015, Chris Dupuis, who then was teaching at an international high school in Amsterdam, joined the X Co.team as a part-time consultant. X Co.helped train the site director in Rotterdam and Amsterdam; X Co.did inspections for fidelity a dozen times over six years, in person; X Co.shared its curriculum and training materials that were then used by the program. An RCT on the Netherlands project shows a statistically strong gain for students who were tutored versus the control group there (0.6 standard deviations), strong evidence of the efficacy of X\u2019s technical assistance/quality assurance.\r\n\r\n(iii)\tProvidence RI (2021)\r\nX Co.began consulting with Providence in 2021 after the district requested help from X Co.to urgently begin a mid-year intervention in the 2020-2021 school year. The consultation began with state and district leaders to identify the needs and systems of Providence, as well as with City Year leaders, as this program involved the district's use of City Year Members as tutors to enable such a late-stage deployment. X Co.conducted a needs assessment, which informed our decision to build out a seven-day training program. X Co.coached school- and City-Year-leaders through the process of starting a program mid-year, and facilitated the training for the City Year members. X Co.staff continue to meet with the program staff bi-weekly to provide coaching and feedback on all aspects of the program. Overall X Co.supported the building and deployment of this program in Providence through assistance with program design, sharing our curriculum and online platform for remote tutoring, providing advice on human capital, training and coaching program leaders, providing\r\npre-service training and in-service coaching of the tutors, and inspecting for fidelity.\r\n\r\n(iv)\tPittsburgh (2019-2020)\r\nPittsburgh hired X Co.to consult on a new after-school tutoring program for grades 6-9 math. X Co.trained the tutors; licensed the X Co.tutorial curriculum and did inspections for fidelity. Importantly, X Co.did not train the supervisors and this was not an in-school-day program. The program supervisors did not welcome X\u2019s feedback during inspections for fidelity, and little evidence was generated about the effectiveness of this\r\n \r\n\r\nprogram.

What is most interesting about this is that both contracts provide state and district funds for X Co.to partner. Further desk research by Bridgespan indicates that there is a significant market for tutoring expansion in the US; there is some level of interest in X\u2019s products; there is a generalized demand for support (and in the case of NM and Chicago, a specific demand); and nothing in the research is inconsistent with our action plan aiming to establish high-dosage tutoring into four of the largest Title I school districts by the end of the three year period.\r\n[8]\tHallmarks that will lead to success\r\nCertain elements are required in order for high impact to be achieved through tutoring, and certain elements are highly recommended but variations are possible, enumerated below. Operationally, X Co.will require districts entering the cohort to have sufficient size and reach to make X\u2019s investment of time worthwhile-this will most often require a minimum tutor corps of 100 tutors. X Co.will ask the districts to commit in good faith to intending to stay in the cohort for three years, and to be committed to exploring how tutoring can be embedded in their districts after three years of time.\r\na)\tRequirements\r\n1.\tTutoring is provided ideally in groups of 2-3 students; rarely 1:1, and rarely 4+\r\n2.\tThe same tutor tutors the group of students throughout the school year\r\n3.\tTutoring is provided 3-5 times per week, or students receive at least 65 hours of personalized tutoring throughout the school year (with 130 hours as a possible maximum)\r\n4.\tTutoring is implemented through the school day, is not a before- or after- school program, and is supplemental to core academic instruction and not a replacement for core classroom instruction.\r\n5.\tCurriculum aligns with classroom instruction or state grade-level academic standards.\r\n6.\tTutoring is data-driven, with formative assessments to inform instructional approaches for students\r\n7.\tThorough pre-service training.\r\n8.\tOngoing in-service coaching for tutors, including frequent observation and feedback cycles embedded in their job (at least twice a week, more in the early stages).\r\nb)\tRecommendation\r\n\r\nTutors can come from many pipelines, including recent grads, mid-career switchers and retirees.

In general, recent advances in AI have an unrealized potential to benefit education, and we believe that high-dosage tutoring programs, and X\u2019s program in particular, present one of the best opportunities to begin capturing more of this potential. Major barriers to realizing the full potential impact of AI in education include the lack of high quality datasets, the complicated nature and diversity of classroom interactions, the complexities of a public education system composed of semi-autonomous districts, the need to understand and address the local learning context, and the associated challenges of implementing and testing possible solutions at scale.\r\nX\u2019s existing Engine 1 model provides a pathway that obviates these barriers. X Co.is already embedded in numerous large districts in a way that accounts for the local context and district complexities while maintaining a standardized program of instruction at significant scale (7,000 students). Within this program, the teaching and learning interactions happen between a tutor and a small number of students, with a high density of one-on-one interactions between tutor and student and additional one-on-one collaborations between students. The tutor-student interactions happen many times per week and across a school year.

The tutor-student interactions happen many times per week and across a school year. In X, almost all of these interactions are with historically underserved students. For each of those interactions, X Co.has a record of the content that was being used, the instructional goals of that content, the artifacts of the student work on the math problems that were covered, an audio transcript, and often (in the case of online tutorial) a video recording of the session. Scholars in the learning sciences have demonstrated the value of this type of multimodal data in understanding the learning process even though such data is currently only available from small laboratory-based studies. Similar use of multimodal data has recently emerged as a driving factor for next-generation AI systems across a range of domains including healthcare, autonomous driving, language translation, question answering, and financial analysis. For these reasons, X Co.is in a position to partner with leading AI researchers and to leverage new AI solutions that emerge.\r\nWe hypothesize that the benefits from AI will largely accrue in the form of human-AI collaborations and that many of these will be in the form of mechanisms that enhance the scalability of X\u2019s tutoring model. It is clear that current-generation AI technology could provide timely and important feedback to tutors and students. One of X\u2019s near-term goals (collaborating with researchers at the University of Colorado) is to deploy an AI-based evaluation system that will analyze recorded tutorial sessions and provide real time feedback on core aspects of X\u2019s instructional rubric just as accurately as a human observer. By combining this analysis capability with an expert (human) tutor-trainers who deliver timely feedback to tutors, we hypothesize that we will both accelerate the tutors' professional development process, reduce the administrative burden of tedious tasks on the expert tutor-trainers, and make the tutor-training and coaching process more scalable.\r\n[10]\tCo-designing systems to address a sense of belonging, a sense of a common group, and a meaningful incentive system for youth\r\nTo illustrate this work with just one design example: A current pain point is that students are not activating their cameras, and the tutor is left trying to connect with the empty black box of the students' video feeds. We are planning to test new avatar systems, which will allow the students to portray themselves within the online domain. The interface will be modified to allow group interactions and games, giving space to focus on interpersonal experiences. This new interface will allow us to also showcase written communication in a way that is equal to spoken communication. A rewards and badging system, tied to the avatar system, that the tutor can use to incentivize behaviors that contribute to the group dynamics.\r\n[11]\tTest the pathways\r\nModel Risk (Impact) - Watering down of high-dosage brand: If tutoring solutions scale without adequate controls and fidelity monitoring, effectiveness may be curbed, leading to less long-term support for tutoring as part of the\r\n \r\n\r\nstandard educational model.\r\nModel Risk (Channel) - District leaders have a mismatched mindset regarding tutoring, what it means, how it works, and what's needed to implement it.\r\nThey sign on and then start to erode the list of requirements.
